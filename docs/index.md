## About the project

`wzrdbrain`  is designed to help wizard skaters discover new trick combinations. By randomizing the sequence of tricks, it can help skaters break out of their usual patterns. 

The project provides both a Python and a JavaScript version of the library.

The JavaScript version is automatically generated from the Python source code using a translation script that leverages the Google Gemini API.
