# Gemini Code Understanding

This document provides a summary of the `wzrdbrain` project, generated by Gemini.

## Project Summary

`wzrdbrain` is a Python library designed to generate random trick combinations for wizard skating. It can create sequences of tricks, ensuring that the transitions between them are logical. Users can also create individual tricks with specific attributes. The project also includes a JavaScript version of the library, which is automatically generated from the Python source code. The current version of the project is 0.1.6.

## Key Files

- **`pyproject.toml`**: The project's configuration file, defining metadata, dependencies, and development settings.
- **`src/wzrdbrain/wzrdbrain.py`**: The core of the library, containing the logic for generating trick combinations in Python.
- **`src/wzrdbrain/tricks.json`**: A JSON file that defines the available wizard skating tricks, including their names, stances, and transition rules.
- **`tests/test_wzrdbrain.py`**: The test suite for the project, ensuring that the trick generation logic works as expected.
- **`utils/translate2js.py`**: A utility script to translate the Python trick data and logic into a JavaScript-compatible format.
- **`src/wzrdbrain/wzrdbrain.src.js`**: The generated JavaScript version of the library.
- **`utils/wzrdbrain.base.js`**: A JavaScript file that contains the base logic for the JavaScript version of the library, used as a reference for the translation script.

## How to Use (Python)

As described in the `README.md`, you can use the `generate_combo` function to get a list of random tricks:

```python
from wzrdbrain import generate_combo

# Generate a combo of 3 tricks
combo = generate_combo(3)

# Get the names of the tricks
trick_names = [trick['name'] for trick in combo]
print(trick_names)
```

## How to Use (JavaScript)

The generated JavaScript module can be used in any JavaScript environment that supports ES6 modules.

```javascript
import { generateCombo } from './wzrdbrain.src.js';

// Generate a combo of 3 tricks
const combo = generateCombo(3);

// Get the names of the tricks
const trickNames = combo.map(trick => trick.name);
console.log(trickNames);
```

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide a tool for wizard skaters to come up with new and creative trick combinations. By randomizing the sequence of tricks, it can help skaters break out of their usual patterns and discover new possibilities. The project also aims to provide a JavaScript version of the library for use in web-based applications.

## Recent Changes

The project has been recently updated to version 0.1.6. This update includes a fix for the `package_data` syntax in the `pyproject.toml` file, ensuring that the `tricks.json` file is correctly included in the package. There have also been a number of documentation updates to improve clarity and consistency.
