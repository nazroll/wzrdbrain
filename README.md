# wzrdbrain

A simple library to generate random trick combinations for wizard skating.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wzrdbrain
```

## Usage

Import the library into your Python script or notebook.

```python
from wzrdbrain import generate_trick, generate_combo
```

Generate a single trick as a list of its parts. 

The `generate_trick` function was deliberately designed this way to allow me to continue developing the semantics for a `trick` generated by a computer. 

```python
print(generate_trick())
# Example output: ['front', 'open', 'lion']
```

Generate a combination (combo) of multiple tricks as formatted strings. Default setting is random, between 2-5 tricks for each combo.

```python
print(generate_combo(3))
# Example output: ['front parallel', 'fakie toe press', 'forward 360']
```

If you want the output of 1 trick as a single formatted string, you can use this example code.

```python
# Generate one trick as a formatted string
print(generate_combo(1))
# Example output: ['fakie toe press']
```
